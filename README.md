# Long-read brain transcript coverage visualisation

This is a shiny app to visualise the coverage of regions expressed across different transcript isoforms in the frontal cortex across development.

The y-axis on the plots is equivalent to a PEXT score, however unlike the PEXT score, we have the transcript isoforms.

For visualisation of the individual transcript isoforms see (UCSC track hub link)

For details of the long-read sequencing and samples see Bamford *et al* https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.24.595768 (Please cite this paper if you use this resource)

To run the app, you can run locally using the `app.R` or visit (Website link)
